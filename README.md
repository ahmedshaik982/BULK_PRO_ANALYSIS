I've combined two datasets - orders and products - to create insightful visualizations.

Here's a breakdown of the process I followed and the visualizations I created:

1. Data Import & Cleaning: Imported the raw data and performed necessary cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

2. Column Creation: Added new columns tailored to the analysis requirements.

3. Data Model: Combined the two data tables into a single, cohesive data model.

4. DAX Measures: Created new measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for enhanced visualization.

5. Slicer: Implemented a slicer to easily filter and visualize product categories.

6. Visualizations:
* Total orders over time per category
* Total orders per month per category
* Total orders based on Google search keywords
* Total vs average orders on a weekly basis
* Total unique products onboarded each month
* Top 10 products based on total order units
* Total number of orders per source
